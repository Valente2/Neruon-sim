# Neruon-sim
Neruon sim is inspried from a simple mathamatical model of a human neruon 
how the progam works is it first asks fior the amount of dendrites (thus the amount of inputs and weights)
Weights for those who are wondering are essentaly a representation on the synapse strength
The program then multiples the each input voltage (in volts)  by the corosponding  synapse strtength add the bias (The bias is a numerical repersentaion of thr nerouns excitment of inhibion)
Then we use  a step funtion to figure out the binary output of the neruon.
